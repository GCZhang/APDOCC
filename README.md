# APDOCC - A Python Dictionary of Color Combinations

The book ['A Dictionary of Color Combinations' by Sanzo Wada](https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Color-Combinations-Various/dp/4861522471) contains a collection of beautifully crafted color combinations. 
This repository creates a digital version of that version that can be used digitally.

This is basically a less polished version of the repository [sanzo-wada by dblodorn](https://github.com/dblodorn/sanzo-wada)
